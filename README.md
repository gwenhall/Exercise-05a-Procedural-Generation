Repeat these steps for scenes 01–15. When you are done, you should have sixteen new scenes in the Maze folder (named 00.tscn–15.tscn). Each of these scenes should have a different texture for the Sprite node. For example, res://Maze/05.tscn should use the res://Assets/05.png file as the texture for the Sprite in that scene.
